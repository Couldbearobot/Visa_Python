# Visa_Python

Mix of scripts found online to help show how to talk to a tektronix oscilloscopes
using the pyvisa (VISA) library/SCPI command protocol

Some scripts have been copied directly and added to, while others have been modified to fit the most recent
verision of the pyvisa platform

for example, scope.ask() is no longer used, but instead scope.query()

Current phase of project:
-copying scripts, adding comments and annotations to better understand the library
-small innovations based on light reading of progamming manual.
-still trying to understand environment
